							<p class="tres">Los Santos is truly one of the most audacious and must see cities of the world. The people are beautiful and their attitudes…well, that’s for you to discover. The city has everything… whether you’re jet-setting, roughing it or in between, it’s ALL here. Los Santos is an urban wonderland with its Babel towers, labyrinth of criss-crossing freeways, side streets, rundown residential districts and glamorous neighbourhoods. Los Santos is a place where you can see it all and have it all.</p>

						<p>If you’re coming in by air, your plane will touch down at the fourth busiest airport in the world, the Los Santos International Airport. Affectionately known as LSX, it was originally built as an airfield for the Los Santos Air National Guard. In 1942 after WWII, it was converted for commercial flights. Since then, millions of people have travelled through the terminals of LSX.</p>
						<p>LSX is now the fourth largest airport in the world. The airport is made up of five gates that are connected by a U-shaped two level terminal. Kerbside check-in is available.</p>

						<p class="sinco">At times you may need to put some distance between yourself and those that are in pursuit. If this is the case, we recommend that you make your way to LSX or take the first train out of Los Santos. Train stations are located within the city limits at Vinewood and in Little Mexico.</p>

						<h4 class="five">RICHMAN</h4>
						
						<p class="six">Richman is one of the most exclusive neighbourhoods in all of Los Santos. The residents of Richman are from the more traditional old money sect. The houses are grandiose and so are their contents. Not that we’re alluding to anything, but sometimes Richman residents tend to leave their doors unlocked. Find a Boxville truck and cruise around the neighbourhoods until you see something you like.</p>

						<p class="six">Mulholland is another exclusive neighbourhood in Los Santos. This neighbourhood is mostly composed of the newly affluent; Vinewood actors, rappers and record producers. This is considered the hippest neighbourhood and if you’re talentless enough to be invited to a party at Mulholland, celebrity sightings are guaranteed. The drive through Mulholland offers some spectacular views of Los Santos, but do exercise caution, the roads can be very windy and narrow.</p>

If you think this is a breathtaking sight from the air, wait til you’re on the ground looking up. Feeling a little adventurous? Have a parachute handy? Some of the urban adrenaline junkies have been known to base jump off the skyscrapers in Downtown Los Santos…but the question is…do you have the güevos?</p>
