							<p class="tres">Los Santos is truly one of the most audacious and must see cities of the world. The people are beautiful and their attitudes…well, that’s for you to discover. The city has everything… whether you’re jet-setting, roughing it or in between, it’s ALL here. Los Santos is an urban wonderland with its Babel towers, labyrinth of criss-crossing freeways, side streets, rundown residential districts and glamorous neighbourhoods. Los Santos is a place where you can see it all and have it all.</p>

						<p>If you’re coming in by air, your plane will touch down at the fourth busiest airport in the world, the Los Santos International Airport. Affectionately known as LSX, it was originally built as an airfield for the Los Santos Air National Guard. In 1942 after WWII, it was converted for commercial flights. Since then, millions of people have travelled through the terminals of LSX.</p>
						<p>LSX is now the fourth largest airport in the world. The airport is made up of five gates that are connected by a U-shaped two level terminal. Kerbside check-in is available.</p>
